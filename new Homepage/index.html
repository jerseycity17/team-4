    	<h3>  Ayurveda </h3>
    	<p> 
		
		Ayurveda (Sanskrit ayur, “life,” or “longevity”; veda, “knowledge,” or “science”; see etymological significance below) or ayurvedic medicine, along with Siddha medicine, are the two primary indigenous medical systems of the Indian subcontinent, Ayurveda principally developing in the north of India, Siddha principally in the south.
		In the interest of comprehensiveness, it should also be mentioned that the originally Graeco-Arabic-Persian medical system known as Unani (or Yunani; 
		see entry) has had a major influence on the domain of medicine and health in India

    	<h3>  Chinese Practices </h3>
    	<p> 
		Traditional Chinese medicine ("TCM"; simplified Chinese: 中医; traditional Chinese: 中醫; pinyin: zhōng yī; literally: 
		"Chinese medicine") is a broad range of medicine practices sharing common concepts which have been developed 
		in China and are based on a tradition of more than 2,000 years, including various forms of herbal medicine,
		acupuncture, massage (Tui na), exercise (qigong), and dietary therapy.
		[1] It is primarily used as a complementary alternative medicine approach. TCM is widely used in China and it is also used in the West.

    	<h3>  Earthing Therapy </h3>
    	<p> 
		Earthing (or grounding) therapy is a practice which proponents claim provides numerous health benefits. 
		The therapy involves being in direct physical contact with the ground or with a device that is electrically grounded.  
		This stems from the idea that in modern life humans are no longer in direct physical contact with the Earth and are 
		therefore losing out on potential health benefits through the exchange of electrons with the surface of our planet. 
		Several studies have suggested that earthing appears to provide some general health benefits,

    	<h3>  Meditation </h3>
    	<p> 

		The Oxford Dictionary defines “to meditate” as: “To think deeply or focus one’s mind for a period of time, in silence 
		or with the aid of chanting, for religious or spiritual purposes or as a method of relaxation.” This is perhaps as good
		a formal starting point as any to begin the consideration 
		of the term’s meaning within the present context of “integrative studies,” with an orientation towards health.
		<p>	The word meditation carries different meanings in different contexts.
